Create a document.. Git Handson_yourname
Practice all the commands in the git readme..

ans put it in the doc one by one..
and commit your doc into your git repo

10 Junit Testcases / Person..
2 Services.. 

1. Dynamic Web Project.. (I will give you repo for it )
Clone it and write a dockerfile to run it on a tomcat server as a container.
Write a docker compose file to run your java application as well as mysql database from a single docker compose file.
Git clone https://github.com/shubhamkushwah123/war-test.git
Hands on must have screen shot of

Creating a pipeline 
1. checkout our code 
2. Build it using Jenkins runtime Maven
3. Build a Docker image using Jenkins provided docker
4. Push the image to DockerHub usign WithCredentials Plugin
5. Deploying the Docker Image to PCF.

make use of pushtocloudfoundly plugin in jenkins

Deploy to tomcat needs to be done on war project .... 1. checkout.. 2. mvn build... test.. 3. deploy to tomcat locally.


Hi @All, here is the assignment detail for today (day 4):
SpringBoot Application -- Jenkins Pipeline (groovy script) -- which needs to be pushed to GitHub Repository that includes:
a) git checkout
b) build & test using jenkins runtime maven
c) build docker image using jenkins runtime docker
d) push the image to dockerhub using withcredentials plugin
e) deploying the docker image to PCF

War-test --> checkout, mvn build & test and deploy to tomcat locally -- again this as well needs to be done using Jenkins pipeline -- however, a screenshot of Jenkins pipeline (groovy script) suffice here and push the screenshot doc as well to GitHub Repo.

Hope I've covered it correctly. Please correct if anything missed.
